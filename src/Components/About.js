            <h3> Hi my name is Mary</h3>
            <p> I am  a mechanical engineer who is currently doing software engineering. I have currently worked with two companies one for mechanical engineering 
                and another took a chance on me in there website development and am very grateful for that opportunity. I am passionate about engineering. I always feel like that there is something  
                very pure about someone designing and bringing to life something. It is a glimpse of a persons soul. This blog is going
                to provide some of the fact in engineering.
